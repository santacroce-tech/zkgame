# ZKGame - Zero-Knowledge Proof-Based Simulation Game

A revolutionary simulation game that combines zero-knowledge proofs with Verifiable Delay Functions (VDF) to create a privacy-preserving, time-locked gaming experience. Players navigate through a fog-of-war world, gather resources, craft items, and participate in a player-driven economy while maintaining complete privacy.

- **Zero-knowledge proof-based gameplay** - All actions are cryptographically proven without revealing private information
- **Complete player privacy** - Inventories, positions, and wealth remain private while being verifiable on-chain
- **Time-locked actions using VDF** - Crafting, travel, and building require computational proof of time passage
- **Fog of war exploration** - Discover new areas and expand your known world
- **Player-owned economy** - Purchase and manage stores, set prices, and trade with other players
- **Resource gathering and crafting** - Collect materials and create valuable items with time requirements
- **Decentralized state management** - All game state is managed through cryptographic commitments

## üèó Development Guide

### Adding New Circuits

1. Create a new `.circom` file in the `circuits/` directory
2. Follow the existing circuit patterns for input/output structure
3. Add the circuit to the compilation script
4. Update the ProofVerifier contract with the new verification function
5. Add corresponding tests

### Modifying Game Constants

Edit `config/game_constants.json` to adjust:
- Movement costs and XP rewards
- Base reward rates
- Crafting requirements
- Store prices
- Resource regeneration rates

### Creating New Recipes

Add new recipes to `config/recipes.json`:
```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "magic_sword",
  "required_materials": [
    {"item_type": "iron_sword", "quantity": 1},
    {"item_type": "magic_crystal", "quantity": 2}
  ],
  "output_item": {"type": "magic_sword", "quantity": 1},
  "required_time_seconds": 7200,
  "experience_reward": 200,
  "skill_level_requirement": 3
}
```

## üèõ Architecture Overview

### How PLONK Proofs Maintain Privacy

ZKGame uses PLONK (Permutation-based zk-SNARK) circuits to prove the validity of game actions without revealing private information:

1. **Private Inputs**: Player state, inventory, position, etc.
2. **Public Inputs**: State commitments, timestamps, action types
3. **Constraints**: Mathematical relationships that must be satisfied
4. **Proof Generation**: Cryptographic proof that constraints are met
5. **Verification**: Fast verification without revealing private data

### How VDF Provides Time-Locks

Verifiable Delay Functions ensure time-locked actions:

1. **Sequential Computation**: VDF requires sequential squaring operations
2. **Time Binding**: Computation time maps to real-world time (278 iterations/second)
3. **Proof Generation**: Wesolowski proof proves correct computation
4. **Circuit Integration**: VDF verification happens inside PLONK circuits
5. **Action Binding**: VDF input is bound to specific player actions

### How State Commitments Work

Game state is managed through cryptographic commitments:

1. **Off-chain State**: Private player data stored locally
2. **State Hashing**: Poseidon hash of complete state
3. **On-chain Commitment**: Only hash stored on blockchain
4. **Proof Verification**: Circuits verify state transitions
5. **Privacy Preservation**: No private data exposed on-chain

### Contract Interaction Flow

1. **Player Action**: CLI generates proof for game action
2. **Proof Submission**: Proof sent to GameCore contract
3. **Verification**: ProofVerifier validates the proof
4. **State Update**: StateManager updates commitments
5. **Event Emission**: Game events logged for indexing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Proof Generation Failures
- **Issue**: Circuit compilation errors
- **Solution**: Check circuit syntax and constraint logic
- **Debug**: Use `circom --verbose` for detailed error messages

#### VDF Computation Errors
- **Issue**: VDF computation fails or is too slow
- **Solution**: Ensure GMP library is properly installed
- **Debug**: Check system resources and VDF calibration

#### State Synchronization Issues
- **Issue**: Local state doesn't match on-chain state
- **Solution**: Verify contract addresses and network connection
- **Debug**: Check commitment hashes and transaction logs

#### Gas Estimation Problems
- **Issue**: Transactions fail due to gas estimation
- **Solution**: Increase gas limit or optimize circuit constraints
- **Debug**: Use Hardhat's gas reporting features
